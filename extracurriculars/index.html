      <h2>Extracurriculars and Interests</h2>
      <p> Some academia-related activities that I have been involved in
        (outside of my field of study) took place at my community college. This
        included participation in the Honors Program, where I met with
        professors to discuss topics outside the scope of the class and wrote
        research papers on issues such as human trafficking and mythological
        female heroes. I also spent months preparing a presentation for a panel
        that explored intersectional feminism and female criticisms. </p>


      <p> A few of my interests involve reading murder mysteries, watching
      psychological thrillers, and traveling. </p>
